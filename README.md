# Lossy Compression by Convolutional Autoencoder

## Project Overview

This project implements lossy image compression using convolutional autoencoders. By leveraging deep learning techniques, we can achieve significant compression rates while maintaining visual quality.

## Introduction

Image compression is essential for efficient storage and transmission of visual data. This repository demonstrates how convolutional neural networks can be used to create compact representations of images through an encoder-decoder architecture.

## Features

- Convolutional autoencoder for image compression
- Customizable compression rates
- Quantitative evaluation of compression performance
- Visual comparison between original and reconstructed images

## Structure

The project is divided into three main subsets:

1. **Model Architecture** - Implementation of the convolutional autoencoder
2. **Training Pipeline** - Code for training the model on image datasets
3. **Evaluation Framework** - Tools to measure compression performance and quality

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- PyTorch
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Pillow

## Usage

Detailed usage instructions and examples will be added soon.

## Results

Performance metrics and visual examples will be provided in this section.
